# Disaster and Business Continuity Project
Disaster and Business Continuity Planning for Rockvale Hospital
## Objective:
To develop and implement a comprehensive disaster recovery and business continuity plan to ensure the resilience of Rockvale Hospital’s operations against potential IT outages, natural disasters, and malicious cyber activities.

## Tools and Methodologies Used:

- SIEM Tools: Splunk, AlienVault
- Regulatory Compliance: HIPAA
- Risk Analysis: NIST, ISO 27001
- Training Platforms: KnowBe4, PhishMe

## Key Responsibilities:
### Review of Laws and Regulations:

- Ensured compliance with the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA), focusing on protecting Protected Health Information (PHI).
- Identified and documented 18 types of information classified as PHI to ensure comprehensive data protection measures.
### Security Controls Selection:

- Developed an Acceptable Use Policy (AUP) to address inappropriate internet usage by medical staff, emphasizing operational controls and deterrent measures.
- Implemented a Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) solution to enhance log collection, analysis, and incident response capabilities, focusing on technical and preventative controls.
### Risk Analysis:

- Conducted qualitative and quantitative risk analyses to evaluate security incidents, and determine the annual rate of occurrence (ARO), single loss expectancy (SLE), and annual loss expectancy (ALE).
- Calculated the Return on Security Investment (ROSI) for the SIEM solution, achieving a ROSI of 260%, justifying the purchase of a next-gen SIEM solution with User and Entity Behavior Analytics (UEBA) and Security Orchestration, Automation, and Response (SOAR).
### Incident Management:

- Diagnosed and resolved security incidents, including spear phishing, hoaxes, and phishing attacks.
- Implemented measures to prevent similar incidents, such as tightening email security and enhancing user awareness.
### Training and Awareness:

- Conducted comprehensive security awareness training for all employees to prevent social engineering attacks.
- Developed and executed phishing simulation campaigns to test and improve employees' responses to potential phishing attempts.
## Achievements:

- Enhanced Security Compliance: Ensured adherence to HIPAA regulations, protecting sensitive patient information.
- Improved Detection and Response: Increased detection and rapid response to security incidents by implementing a SIEM solution.
- Cost Savings: Reduced annual security incident costs by 90%, leading to significant cost savings for the organization.
- Increased Preparedness: Improved the hospital’s preparedness for IT outages and natural disasters, ensuring continuous patient care and operational resilience.
